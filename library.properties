sentence=A modern, robust communication protocol for the age of AI. Enhanced Arduino CAN Bus library with pub/sub protocol, persistent IDs, automatic subscription restoration, and extended frame support.
paragraph=Supports Microchip MCP2515 based boards/shields and the Espressif ESP32's built-in SJA1000 compatible CAN controller. Features complete broker-client architecture with topic-based messaging, sequential client ID assignment (1, 2, 3...), persistent ID registration with serial numbers, automatic subscription restoration after power cycles, extended CAN frames for messages >8 bytes, flash memory persistence (ESP32 NVS/Arduino EEPROM), and event-driven callbacks. Client mappings and subscriptions survive power cycles.
