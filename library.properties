sentence=Enhanced Arduino CAN library with built-in MQTT-like publish/subscribe protocol and persistent storage.
paragraph=Supports Microchip MCP2515 based boards/shields and the Espressif ESP32's built-in SJA1000 compatible CAN controller. Includes complete MQTT-like broker-client architecture for topic-based messaging, automatic client ID assignment with serial number registration, flash memory persistence (ESP32 NVS/Arduino EEPROM), and event-driven callbacks. Client mappings survive power cycles. Based on arduino-CAN by Sandeep Mistry.
